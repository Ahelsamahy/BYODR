## Schemes
The documentation is made with care but might have mistakes.  
Always try to understand the logic.  
Documentation is never complete, things keep changing and there is no end to the details.  
In this way documentation looks like fractals.  
Note: We are a software organisation. We build this robot on request of our users.  
They request robust, easy to maintain and not to expensive, robot build with materials that are available al over the world. 
We had the robot design checked by an engineering organisation but it's at your own risk to use the robot.  
<br>
We use schemes as our basis. The other documentation is maintained after the schemes.
