## Instructions<br>
The instructions are exported from our development tools. The information might be a bit cryptic.<br> We are always in for improvements. Don't hesitate to contact us, if you need some help or need an extra picture.<br>
## Content<br>
The robot is assembled in main stages:<br>- Chassis<br>- Body: External skeleton<br>- Body: Enclosure<br>- Cables, equipment<br>- Enclosure lock and camera's<br>- Configuration<br><br>
# Chassis<br>
## Arrma Kraton 8S<br>
The  Kraton 8s is the largest Arrma model, but much too fast and with minimal carrying capacity.<br>To be able to carry more cargo, the vehicle must be converted so that the motors for steering and driving last longer.<br>
Before the chassis can work for the robot we has to change some parts.<br>- Springs<br>- Steering servo<br>
After unpacking take off:<br>- Cover Green/Orange ARA409001/7<br>- 2* Battery holder ARA320496<br>- Back spoiler, ARA480022<br>- Spoiler mount, ARA320492<br>- ARA320485<br>- Some small parts like bolts and nuts<br>
## Springs<br>
Change the springs<br>Put the large springs on the place of the originals an the small around the shock shaft.<br>Find a video with explanation.<br>Note: The front springs are shorter than the back springs(ARA330572 and ARA330573)<br>
## Change steering servo<br>
This is a tricky operation, take some time to look for the video's, with instrucitons.<br>- Place batteries in handunit<br>- Mark position servo saver both on the saver and the casing with something sharp so you know afterwards if it fits correct.<br>- Release ESC/Servo unit, 4 screews bottom<br>- Release cover, 6 small screws<br>- Release reciever<br>- Release steering rod from servo saver tot steering on sterring(watch out not to lose little nut )<br>-Release plastic contra bolt in servo saver, watch out, releasing is clockwise!!!<br>- release bolt far in servo saver to release is form the servo. Release safer with allen screw driver.<br>Of the content of the package we don’t use the spring and the steering linkage.<br>Change the servo, take care its exactly well positoned.<br>
After changing the servo you can remove the receiver<br>
## Esc settings<br>
Change ESC settings accoring to manual.<br>- Low votage cut-off(variable 3) to Low(setting 1)<br>- Brake strenght(5), 10%(7)<br>- Reverse strength(6), 75%(3)<br>- Punch setting(7), level 1(1)<br>
## Red wires of the button<br>
Shortcut the red wires of the button<br>Use the orange ferrule double and the heat shrink.<br>
## Cable gland bottom<br>
Before putting the enclosure on the robot, first put the cable gland around the cable from the ESC.<br>- Take a M25 Cable gland<br>- Put contra nut around cables.<br>
- Multi seal, M25, 3 holes. Cut the holes open to put the cables through.<br>- First put smal cable through one hole then the red and black from the esc each through their own holes.<br>Then put ring from cable gland around it Asure that the shortest wire, the steering servo connector is reachabel in the enclosure. The gland must be quite tide to the chassis<br>
# External skeleton<br>
The skeleton is build with the aluminium profile. 20 x 20 mm, groove 5.<br>
We have two kinds, both for groove 5 but 1 kind for allan screw M5 and 1 kind for Allan screw M4 that is used for the brackets.<br>
![](img/instructions/img204120.jpg)<br>
## Crossbeams<br>
Connect 2 crosbeams, 0,3m to the bottom of the chassis.<br>Use the empty holes from the battery holders<br>
## Pillars<br>
Attach 4 pillars(0,14m) with brackets on the crossbeams.<br>
## Longitudinal beams<br>
On the pillars the longitudinal beams are fetched.<br>At the right side 0,76m.<br>At the left side 0,81m.<br>At the front, both beams wil end just before the front camera.<br>At the back, the right beam stops 0,02m after the enclosure. The left goes further to the back to mount the back camera.<br>The longitudinal beams should be close to the bottom of the enclosure but don't push it up. The enclosure should rett on the towers of the chassis.<br>
## Cross beams high<br>
On the longitudinal beams the high crossbeams  of 0,2m are attached. They are close to the enclosure to keep it at its place<br>
## Lock pillars<br>
At both the front and the back side, attached to the high crossbeams, there should be a lock pillar of 0,11m. In a later stage the lock longitudinal beam wil be attached to these pillars.<br>
## Mount front Camera<br>
Hinge<br>6  m5 10<br>Tripod screw schroef<br>6 washer m5<br>Slide nut<br>Extra bracket to lock camera<br>
## Mount back Camera<br>
Hinge<br>6  m5 10<br>Tripod screw schroef<br>6 washer m5<br>Slide nut<br>Extra bracket to lock camera<br>
# Enclosure<br>
In the end the enclosure will look more or less like:<br>
![](img/instructions/img204405.jpg)<br>
Don't forget to put in a sack of silica gel. But this can be done any time<br>
## Spelsberg AKL-4-t <br>
The Spelsberg enclosure AKL-4-t has transparant cover, metric pre-embossings.<br>A bit cheaper alternative enclosure has a non transparant cover.<br>The enclosure should rest on the front and back towers of the chassis.<br>As the center tower is just slightly lower and the bottom of the enclosure has ridges, we away some the two smalls bumps just aside of the middle cross ridge with an soldering iron.<br>At the end we put some double adhesive tape at the towers.<br>
