#### Content<br>
The robot is assembled in main stages:<br>- Chassis<br>- Body: External skeleton<br>- Body: Enclosure<br>- Cables, equipment<br>- Enclosure lock and camera's<br>- Configuration<br><br>
# Chassis<br>
#### Arrma Kraton 8S<br>
The  Kraton 8s is the largest Arrma model, but much too fast and with minimal carrying capacity.<br>To be able to carry more cargo, the vehicle must be converted so that the motors for steering and driving last longer.<br>
Before the chassis can work for the robot we has to change some parts.<br>- Springs<br>- Steering servo<br>- Tires<br>
After unpacking take off:<br>- Cover Green/Orange ARA409001/7<br>- 2* Battery holder ARA320496<br>- Back spoiler, ARA480022<br>- Spoiler mount, ARA320492<br>- ARA320485<br>- 4* Wheels//tires ARA510122/520055/550061<br>- Some small parts like bolts and nuts<br>
#### Springs<br>
Change the springs<br>First we change the springs to make it more firm and have less pressure on the shocks.<br>Put the large springs on the place of the originals an the small around the shock shaft.<br>Find a video with explanation.<br>Note: The front springs are shorter than the back springs(ARA330572 and ARA330573)<br>
#### Esc tuning<br>
Change ESC settings according to  Kraton 8S instruction manual.<br>- Low votage cut-off(variable 3) to Low(setting 1)<br>- Brake strenght(5), 10%(7)<br>- Reverse strength(6), 75%(3)<br>- Punch setting(7), level 1(1)<br>
#### Change steering servo<br>
This is a tricky operation, take some time to look for the video's, with instrucitons.<br>- Place batteries in handunit<br>- Start the kraton and the hand unit, set the steering wheels in sytait forward<br>- Mark position servo saver both on the saver and the casing with something sharp, screwdriver,  so you know afterwards if it fits correct.<br>- Switch everything off<br>- Release ESC/Servo unit, 4 screws bottom<br>- Release cover, 6 small screws<br>- Release reciever, and wires from the box. Take the antenner wire out of the little tube.<br>- Release steering rod from servo saver to the steering connector on steering(watch out not to lose little nut )<br>-Release plastic contra bolt in servo saver. Watch out, releasing is clockwise!!!<br>- release bolt far in servo saver to release is form the servo. Release safer with allen screw driver.<br>- Take the new servo, connect the wire to the servo firtst.<br>- Take the new reciever box. Check if the new servo fits.<br>- Swap the data cable on the receiver.<br>Of the content of the package we don’t use the spring and the steering linkage.<br>Change the servo, take care its exactly well positoned.<br>
After changing the servo you can remove the receiver<br>
#### Wire shortcuts<br>
__ Red wires of the button__ <br>Shortcut the red wires of the button<br>Use the orange ferrule double and the heat shrink.<br>Heatshrink 2,5mm 2:1 covering the ferrule metal tube.<br>Heatschink 6mm, 3:1, coverin the ferrule.<br>
#### Cable gland bottom<br>
Before putting the enclosure on the robot, first put the cable gland around the cable from the ESC.<br>- Take a M25 Cable gland<br><br>
- Multi seal, M25, 3 holes. Cut the holes open to put the cables through.<br>- First put smal cable through one hole then the red and black from the esc each through their own holes.<br>Then put ring from cable gland around it Asure that the shortest wire, the steering servo connector is reachabel in the enclosure. The gland must be quite tide to the chassis.<br>Put the cable gland on it and go to the section for making the bottom hole.<br>
# External skeleton<br>
The skeleton is build with the aluminium profile. 20 x 20 mm, groove 5.<br>
We have two kinds, both for groove 5 but 1 kind for allan screw M5 and 1 kind for Allan screw M4 that is used for the brackets.<br>
![](img/instructions/img204120.jpg)<br>
#### Crossbeams<br>
Connect 2 crosbeams, 0,23m to the bottom of the chassis.<br>Use the empty holes from the battery holders<br>
#### Pillars<br>
Attach 4 pillars, 0,14m with brackets on the low crossbeams. The bracket are under the chassis.<br>
#### Longitudinal beams<br>
On the pillars the longitudinal beams are fetched.<br>At the right side 0,74m.<br>At the left side 0,81m.<br>At the front, both beams wil end just before the front camera.<br>At the back, the right beam stops at the end of the enclosure. The left goes further to the back to mount the back camera.<br>The longitudinal beams should be close to the bottom of the enclosure but don't push it up. The enclosure should rett on the towers of the chassis.<br>
#### Cross beams high<br>
On the longitudinal beams the high crossbeams  of 0,23m are attached. They are close to the enclosure to keep it at its place<br>
#### Lock pillars<br>
At both the front and the back side, attached to the high crossbeams, there should be a lock pillar of 0,13m. In a later stage the lock longitudinal beam wil be attached to these pillars.<br>
#### Mount front Camera<br>
Bracket 150*150mm with per side 3 holes<br>2  m5 10<br>Tripod screw 8mm<br>2 repairwasher m5<br>2 washer m5<br>2 Slide nut<br><br>
#### Mount back Camera<br>
Hinge<br>6  m5 10<br>Tripod screw schroef<br>6 washer m5<br>Slide nut<br>Extra bracket to lock camera<br>
# Enclosure<br>
In the end the enclosure will look more or less like the picture.<br>But we have to admit, every build we find an improvement. Less cables, less space, more easy to open.<br>In this instructions you find our last build.<br>Sometimes we get a request for a large battery. This takes some space.<br>
![](img/instructions/img204405.jpg)<br>
Don't forget to put in a sack of silica gel. But this can be done any time<br>
#### Spelsberg AKL-4-t <br>
The Spelsberg enclosure AKL-4-t has transparant cover, metric pre-embossings.<br>A bit cheaper alternative enclosure has a non transparant cover.<br>The enclosure should rest on the front and back towers of the chassis.<br>As the center tower is just slightly lower and the bottom of the enclosure has ridges, we away some the two smalls bumps just aside of the middle cross ridge with an soldering iron.<br>At the end we put some double adhesive tape at the towers.<br>
![](img/instructions/img204415.jpg)<br>
#### Holes, glands, conector an buttons<br>
See scheme voor the location and size of the holes.<br>It might be a suggestion to keep the part that needs the hole, nearby to see if it fits.<br>We always start with the bottom-hole and make is fit completely, even by putting the cables through the gland and see if the enclosure fits well.<br><br>
__ Bottom hole __ <br>One of the more tricky parts is the location of the bottom hole for the M25 cable gland with the ESC power and  datacabels.<br>The outside bottom of the enclosure has ridge wicht shoot stay intact.<br>Check with the already attache cable gland the location<br>
__ Charge connector __<br>Avoid ths the hole gets more to the top of the enclosre. The screws to tiden theRosenberger-connector need some space.<br><br>
__ Antenna cables __ <br>The 5 antenna cables should be at the back-side left. Bring the cables aroun 0,15m within the enclosure.<br>- Put the close nut over the cable connetors<br>- Take the black closing ring from the gland and put it also over the connectors.<br>- Take the multie seal with 5 holse, cut the holes en put the cables through.<br>First put the cable gland over the cables before putting is in het enclosure.<br>Don't make the cable gland to tide yet.<br>Using a multi seal, 5 holes.<br>Take the multi seal, cut the 5 holes with scissors.<br>Put the cabels throught the closing ring of the gland.<br>Put the cables in the holes of the multi seal <br>Put around the multis seal the big single seal from the cable gland.<br>Put the cables through the cable gland.<br><br>
__ WAN __ <br>Put the WAN connector more to the back then the LAN connector.<br>Use a self-adhesive cable mount, under the enclosure, to keep the cap to the vehicle wen not on the connector. <br>
__ LAN __<br>Lan connector<br>
