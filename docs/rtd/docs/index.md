# Build Your Own Delivery Robot

![](img/autopilot/rover_front.png)

Welcome, please feel free to browse or follow along the reading order as outlined below.

## Introduction

The main function of our robot is routine transport of small goods, such as packages or inspection equipment, using simple routes.  
As there is no driver on board the vehicle it can be smaller, cheaper and consume less energy. 
Without a driver on board there is a need for remote supervision by an operator or traffic controller.   

The robot has three modes to give an operator and/or traffic controller supervision over the vehicle and to save time:  

1. Teleoperation - via internet on a browser  
1. An autopilot with remote supervision - drive simple routes  
1. An option to train the autopilot - drive more complex routes    

> The robot is built with *publicly available parts exclusively* and can be assembled by anyone.

## Get Started
* Get a robot. Use the parts list and  [assembly instructions](mwlc_kit.md) or place [an order](mwlc_order.md) if you prefer pre-assembly.
* Read about [startup and maintenance](startup_manual.md).
* Setup the vpn. Have a look at our step-by-step [ZeroTier guide](zerotier_manual.md). 
* Connect as your robot's [operator](operator_manual.md). Learn to use the controller and take the first spin.
* Use and train your robot's [autopilot](autopilot_manual.md).
